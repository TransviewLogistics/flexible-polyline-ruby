# flexible-polyline-ruby


Decoder for flexible polylines. Code was translated from the js version in [this repo](https://github.com/heremaps/flexible-polyline).

No encoder is provided because we have no use for it.

Add `gem 'flexible_polyline'` to your gemfile to install it.

Usage is: `FlexiblePolyliune::Decoder.new.decode(my_flexible_polyline)`.
